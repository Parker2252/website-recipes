<h3>This scallop pasta dish is a very simple, easy to prepare meal that you will most likely be asked to make again.</h3>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 pounds sea scallops, rinsed and patted dry</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy cream (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add angel hair pasta and cook, uncovered, for 4 to 5 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
    <li>While the pasta is cooking, melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in garlic and cook just until fragrant and softened, about 1 minute. Slice any scallops over 3/4-inch thick in half so they'll cook evenly; stir scallops, basil, and parsley into the skillet. Cook and gently stir just until scallops feel slightly firm when pressed with a finger, about 2 to 3 minutes. Scallops will become tough and chewy if overcooked.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to low; stir in lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Pour in cream if you like a thicker sauce and cook just until the sauce begins to simmer.</li>
    <li>Ladle scallops and sauce over hot pasta and sprinkle Parmesan cheese over top.</li>
</ol>
